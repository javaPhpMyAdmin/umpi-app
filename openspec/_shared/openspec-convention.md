## Artifact File Paths

| Skill | Creates / Reads | Path |
|-------|----------------|------|
| orchestrator | Creates/Updates | `openspec/changes/{change-name}/state.yaml` |
| sdd-init | Creates | `openspec/config.yaml`, `openspec/specs/`, `openspec/changes/`, `openspec/changes/archive/` |
| sdd-explore | Creates (optional) | `openspec/changes/{change-name}/exploration.md` |
| sdd-propose | Creates | `openspec/changes/{change-name}/proposal.md` |
| sdd-spec | Creates | `openspec/changes/{change-name}/specs/{domain}/spec.md` |
| sdd-design | Creates | `openspec/changes/{change-name}/design.md` |
| sdd-tasks | Creates | `openspec/changes/{change-name}/tasks.md` |
| sdd-apply | Updates | `openspec/changes/{change-name}/tasks.md` (marks `[x]`) |
| sdd-verify | Creates | `openspec/changes/{change-name}/verify-report.md` |
| sdd-archive | Moves | `openspec/changes/{change-name}/` → `openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-{change-name}/` |
| sdd-archive | Updates | `openspec/specs/{domain}/spec.md` (merges deltas into main specs) |

## Writing Rules

- Always create the change directory before writing artifacts.
- If a file already exists, READ it first and UPDATE it (don't overwrite blindly).
- If the change directory already exists with artifacts, the change is being CONTINUED.
- Use `openspec/config.yaml` `rules` section for project-specific constraints per phase.

## Delta Spec Sections

Delta specs MAY include these sections:

```markdown
## ADDED Requirements
## MODIFIED Requirements
## REMOVED Requirements
## RENAMED Requirements
```

- `ADDED` appends new requirements to the main spec.
- `MODIFIED` replaces the full matching requirement block in the main spec. The delta MUST contain the entire updated requirement, including unchanged scenarios that must be preserved.
- `REMOVED` deletes the matching requirement from the main spec. Each removed requirement MUST include `(Reason: ...)` and SHOULD include `(Migration: ...)` when consumers or persisted behavior are affected.
- `RENAMED` changes a requirement heading/name without changing behavior unless the delta also includes a `MODIFIED` block for the new requirement. Each rename MUST state old and new names explicitly.

## Archive Structure

When archiving, the change folder moves to:
```
openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-{change-name}/
```

Use today's date in ISO format. The archive is an AUDIT TRAIL — never delete or modify archived changes.
